## Hi! I'm Grzegorz or Greg if you prefer. 
I'm an engineer. Former gas turbines/aviation experience gave me pragmatism, teamwork and care of what I do.
Then I learned programming... and I loved it as building things became faster... waaay faster.
I'm mostly interested in JS, Web Scraping, DDD and Software Architecture.
I love talking to business and learning/supporting on solving business critical challenges.
After more than 10 years of professional experience, I can offer:
- consulting on business solutions
- DDD culture and Event Storming support
- JS/TS backend dev/ Especially: Astro, Strapi or any other headless CMSes and static site generators
- Web Scraping solutions
- Cloud scalable, serverless solutions
